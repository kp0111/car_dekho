In my SQL project centered around CarDekho.com sales data spanning from 2015 to 2023, I meticulously examined various aspects of the dataset. Employing MySQL, I began by reading the data and obtaining a count of table records. The project delved into responding to managerial inquiries such as predicting the number of cars available in 2023, as well as the count for each year from 2020 to 2023.

The client's request to print the total of all cars by year prompted further exploration. The car dealer agent was consulted to determine the number of diesel cars expected in 2023, and the client sought information on the count of petrol cars in 2020. The manager instructed the employee to print details of all fuel types (petrol, diesel, and CNG) across all years.

Analyzing the dataset, I identified the years with over 100 cars and reported them as per the manager's directive. Additionally, the manager emphasized the need for a complete list of car count details between 2015 and 2023.

Throughout the project, SQL queries were crafted to address each specific question, leveraging the capabilities of MySQL. The detailed exploration of car types, brands, and fuel variants provided a comprehensive understanding of the CarDekho.com sales data, showcasing the versatility of SQL in data analysis and reporting.
